Let's Eat

I think what i'm going to do here is compile recipes that i have tried or created. I want to have a picture with each recipe of the final product. I may also try to add a separate section for things Lici (my sister) and I cook together too.

No recipes that i WANT to make, only ones i've tried and know are good...you know, for posterity.
