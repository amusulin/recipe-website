https://github.com/amusulin/recipe-website.git

I think what i'm going to do here is compile recipes that i have tried or created. I want to have a picture with each recipe of the final product. I may also try to add a separate section for things Lici (my sister) and I cook together too.

No recipes that i WANT to make, only ones i've tried and know are good...you know, for posterity.

•	Your project is built “mobile first” Your media queries should scale up to handle larger devices. You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience
    -- media queries to change main content from vertical mobile to horizontal desktop
    -- media queries to change position of aside from top at vertical to docked right on desktop
    -- media query to change navigation from vertical mobile to horizontal desktop
    -- media query to change size of .welcome (title banner) to make it bigger and show more of the picture on desktop


3 included from CSS list
•	A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item
    -- navigation switches from vertical for mobile to horizontal for desktop
•	Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
    -- used flexbox to change order of favorite recipe; when mobile it is inserted at the top and when it moves to desktop it is docked to the right of the screen
•	Create your own original CSS animation.
    -- used a media query with css styling to animate the favorite recipe aside so that on desktop it crawls in from the right
    --uses keyframes to format animation

1 included from JavaScript Features List
•	Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)
    -- name field gets validated and called back as part of thank you message

Github
•	Your required 5 commits is only a minimum. We hope to see dozens or hundreds of commits.
    -- exceeds 5 commits with actual content change
•	Naming your project
    -- named recipe-website (relevant as it is a recipe website)
